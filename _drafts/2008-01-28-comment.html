Well my website http://maniezhilan.homelinux.org is 100% java based and i hosted it without spending a penny (if you have tried to host java based website you must be knowing how much it costs).<br />Ok the deal goes like this,<br /><br />1. Get an DNS name from DynDNS.com for free<br />2. No need to get a static ip to map your DNS name, there is ddclient software available , which will resolve your ip changes  done by your ISP  transparently.<br />3.Install ubuntu 7.10 gutsy gubbon , install it as cmd line (it doesnt crash during installation as the gui), make sure you download the right software like x86 or 64 bit , i have a cluster of both machines.<br />4.Download and setup apache webserver and do port forwarding in your router for port 80 or port of your choice.<br />5.Download and setup jboss<br />6. Connect your apache with jboss through mod_jk<br /><br />for all of the steps mentioned above there are numerous blogs available to help,  just google it.<br /><br />Note: I did this with my old laptop without much screw up , so i would recommend start with some old desktops or laptops and make sure u have all the backups before experimenting.<br /><br />why did i host the website instead of using some other famous websites like myspace or orkut to put my photos, if thats what you've seen in webpage (i know you can't resist), well the advantage is i can access my home machine from anyhwere in the world,  i can  also put some source code for my techblogs and tutorials to mention few.Checkout the java side by accessing the jboss-seam tutorials,<br />http://maniezhilan.homelinux.org/seam-blog<br /><br />The above said may sound like conservative radio or tv hosts ie both questions and answers said by the same person (in tamil - kelviyum nane pathilum nane)(certainly i am not referring to  Bill Oreilly or Glen Beck ...he he). Thanks to these guys i saved money by canceling my cable.
