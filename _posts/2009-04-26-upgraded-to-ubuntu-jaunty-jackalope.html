Wow !!!, thats my initial reaction to the jaunty. The reason being i have used ubuntu from Gutsy, hardy and interpid. All the above release had some glitches with my crazy architecture (AMD64 running on VMWare Server on vista home basic , partition on my external hard disk plugged through an USB port).<br /><br />The upgrade was easy , but this time it was slow may be too many users downloading it.<br /><br />I always had trouble with flash player on AMD64, but in jaunty it works like an charm. Oh hoo ..youtube for my wife on Ubuntu.<br /><br />Visual Effects never used to work for my Nvidia , but with jaunty i get custom visual effects.<br /><br /><p>The booting is lightning fast.<br /></p><p>Lot of themes to choose from , i chose the Dust, its awesome.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><p></p>
