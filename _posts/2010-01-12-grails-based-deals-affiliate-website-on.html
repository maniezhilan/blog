When i am not working i spend most of the time looking for good deals on tech stuffs. I was wondering how this business model works. Quick search got me Linkshare and Commission junction.<br />I thought of creating such an website myself. Since i already have my website running on appengine with grails, setting up such an website was just an breeze, i used the Data feeds from affiliates. I used the rome to read the RSS feeds. Voila <a href="http://deals.maniezhilan.org">Deals website</a> is born in no time.
