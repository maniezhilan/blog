The moment i saw on dzone about the google appengine for java, i applied for an early bird account and i was promptly given an account in 24 hours. Its an coincidence or something my home ubuntu linux hosting my <a href="http://maniezhilan.org">website</a> was not able to be accessed , may be my port 80 was blocked by my ISP. Anyways i thought let me try to host my website on google appengine. I was able to host my <a href="http://maniezhilan.appspot.com">website</a> in couple of hours without any glitch.<br /><br />The things i liked about the appengine are,<br />1. The eclipse plugin.<br />2. Jetty Server<br />3. The GWT plugin (good reason to learn GWT)<br />4. Ease of deployment to the cloud.<br />5. Gives avid java professional's like me to use java based website instead of my previous drupal CMS based on php.<br />6. I saw one post on dzone about someone's stint of seam on appengine (going to be my next task)<br />7. Use of google infrastructure api's like Users authentication (in my website i use it for comments section), other things i get on appengine are my own domain email id ex. mani@maniezhilan.org (for which i had difficulties when tried postfix mailserver from my home ubuntu mainly due to my dynamic ip shooting emails...spammer mani).<br />8. I can use either JDO or JPA as persistence mechanism. My favorite is JPA.<br />9. It supports lot of different languages (including my mother tongue Tamil).<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=RcoVQU7h/OY&amp;offerid=141510.10000014&amp;type=4&amp;subid=0"><img border=0 alt="Banner 468x60" src="http://images.compusa.com/adserve/compusa_default_468x60.gif"></a><img border=0 width=1 height=1 alt=banner src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=RcoVQU7h/OY&amp;bids=141510.10000014&type=4&amp;subid=0">
